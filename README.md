<a name="about"></a>
## 💻 About the game
As a final work to my first semester at the college, I made a basic version of the arcade game R-type. It is originally a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game where the player controls a spaceship to destroy the Bydo empire. For practice and creative reasons, some changes were made. It's possible to download the game at the Releases section in the sidebar.
